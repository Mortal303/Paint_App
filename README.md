# Pseudo-elements

A CSS **pseudo-element** is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.

```
/* This will change first line of every <p> element to red color. */
p::first-line {
  color: red;
  text-transform: lowercase;
}
```
